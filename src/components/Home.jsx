              The decentralized electronic health record is a system that allows
              patients and doctors alike to be able to track someone's
              electronic health record on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally,
              doctors are able to update their patients' records so long as
              their patient has marked them as an "approved doctor" for them. By
              having a decentralized electronic health record, doctors and
              patients around the world will be able to access their latest
              health record, and will no longer have to fill out individual
              health records each time they go to a new doctor.
